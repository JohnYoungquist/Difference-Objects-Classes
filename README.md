# Difference-Objects-Classes

D:# Difference Between Objects and Classes in Java

This project demonstrates the **conceptual and practical difference** between *objects* and *classes* in Java using a simple `Car` class example.

### ðŸ”¹ What is a Class?
A **class** is a template that defines properties and behaviors for objects. It does not occupy memory until it's instantiated. Think of it like a recipe.

### ðŸ”¹ What is an Object?
An **object** is an instance of a class. It is a **real entity** that occupies memory and performs actual tasks defined by the class. Think of it as the cake made using a recipe.

## Conceptual Differences

| Feature       | Class                             | Object                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Definition   | Blueprint for objects              | Real instance of a class         |
| Memory       | Does not occupy memory by itself   | Occupies memory                  |
| Usage        | Defines structure & behavior       | Performs real actions            |
| Syntax       | `class Car {}`                     | `Car myCar = new Car()`          |
